# Story 1.14: Event-Driven Notifications - Implementation Summary (Phase 1.14a)

**Status:** ✅ **PHASE 1.14a COMPLETE** (Core Notification Service)  
**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Branch:** `cursor/integrate-admin-service-audit-logging-2890`  
**Estimated Effort:** 10-14 hours (Phase 1.14a: ~5 hours)  
**Actual Effort:** ~4 hours

---

## 📋 Overview

Successfully implemented Phase 1.14a of the event-driven notification system. This phase delivers core notification functionality with direct event handling (without MassTransit). Clients now receive SMS notifications when their KYC status changes.

**Implementation Approach:**
- **Phase 1.14a (COMPLETE):** Core notification service, event handlers, consent checking, template personalization
- **Phase 1.14b (FUTURE):** MassTransit/RabbitMQ integration, DLQ handling, advanced analytics

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Event Flow (Phase 1.14a)

```
Workflow Worker Completion
    ↓
Domain Event Created
    ↓
Event Handler Invoked (Fire-and-Forget)
    ↓
Consent Validation
    ↓
Template Personalization
    ↓
NotificationService.SendWithRetry
    ↓
Retry Policy (Polly)
    ↓
CommunicationsClient
    ↓
SMS Delivery
```

### Notification Templates

**Template IDs:**
1. `kyc_approved` - KYC verification completed
2. `kyc_rejected` - KYC verification rejected
3. `kyc_edd_required` - EDD escalation notification
4. `edd_approved` - EDD review approved
5. `edd_rejected` - EDD review rejected

**Sample Template (kyc_approved):**
```
Good news {ClientName}! Your KYC verification is complete as of {CompletionDate}. 
Your loan application will proceed to the next stage. 
For updates, contact your branch at {BranchContact}. - IntelliFin
```

### Consent Enforcement

**Consent Rules:**
- Only `ConsentType = "Operational"` consents checked
- Must have `SmsEnabled = true`
- `ConsentRevokedAt` must be `null`
- Blocked notifications logged for compliance
- No consent = No notification (fail-safe)

### Retry Strategy

**Polly Retry Policy:**
- Max Retries: 3
- Delays: 2s, 4s, 8s (exponential backoff)
- Retryable: HttpRequestException, network errors
- Non-retryable: Permanent failures
- DLQ: After max retries (logged for now)

## 🎓 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Fire-and-Forget Pattern
**Decision:** Use `Task.Run()` for async event handling  
**Rationale:** Notifications shouldn't block workflow completion  
**Trade-off:** Notification failures don't fail workflows (logged instead)

### 2. Direct Event Handling (No MassTransit Yet)
**Decision:** Invoke handlers directly in Phase 1.14a  
**Rationale:** Faster delivery, simpler testing, incremental approach  
**Future:** MassTransit in Phase 1.14b for production-grade messaging

### 3. Consent-First Approach
**Decision:** Check consent before any notification processing  
**Rationale:** Privacy compliance, cost optimization  
**Benefit:** Zero notifications to non-consented users

### 4. Rejection Reason Sanitization
**Decision:** Map internal reasons to customer-friendly messages  
**Rationale:** Security, professionalism, customer experience  
**Examples:** "Sanctions" → "Additional verification required"

### 5. Scoped Service Lifetime
**Decision:** All services registered as Scoped  
**Rationale:** Per-request DbContext access, safe for concurrent requests  
**Benefit:** Proper EF Core usage patterns
