2. Database schema with migrations
3. REST API with authentication
4. Basic risk calculation logic
5. Health checks and metrics
6. Docker containerization
7. Kubernetes deployment

9. Documentation

### üîß Needs Enhancement for Production
1. **External API Integrations** - Replace stub responses with actual API calls
2. **Vault Configuration** - Replace default config with actual Vault API
3. **Comprehensive Testing** - Write full test suite (currently ~5 tests)
4. **Camunda Worker** - Implement actual Zeebe task polling
5. **Performance Testing** - Load test and optimize

**Estimated Enhancement Time**: 2-3 weeks

## Deployment Strategy

### Gradual Rollout Plan

**Phase 1: Deploy Passive** (Week 1)
- Deploy microservice to production
- Keep feature flag at 0%
- Monitor health and metrics
- Fix any deployment issues

**Phase 2: 10% Traffic** (Week 2)
- Enable feature flag for 10% of requests
- Monitor for 48 hours
- Compare decisions with embedded service
- Verify no performance degradation

**Phase 3: 50% Traffic** (Week 3)
- Increase to 50% if metrics healthy
- Monitor for another 48 hours
- Track error rates and latency

**Phase 4: Full Cutover** (Week 4)
- Move to 100% if all metrics green
- Monitor for 1 week
- Plan to decommission embedded logic

**Phase 5: Decommission** (Week 6)
- Remove embedded credit assessment code
- Archive legacy implementation
- Full microservice operation

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ 99.9% availability
- ‚úÖ p95 latency < 5 seconds
- ‚úÖ Error rate < 2%
- ‚úÖ Decision parity > 90% with embedded service
