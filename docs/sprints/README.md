## üèóÔ∏è Microservices Architecture

The sprint planning is aligned with our final, consolidated microservices architecture:

### Core Microservices (Target Consolidated Architecture)
- **IntelliFin.ApiGateway** - Centralized entry point and routing
- **IntelliFin.IdentityService** - Authentication and authorization
- **IntelliFin.ClientManagementService** - Customer management and KYC
- **IntelliFin.LoanOriginationService** - Loan application and credit assessment (consolidated)
- **IntelliFin.CreditBureauService** - Credit bureau integration (ACL)
- **IntelliFin.FinancialService** - GL, payments, and collections (consolidated from GeneralLedger + Collections + PmecService)
- **IntelliFin.PmecAclService** - PMEC integration (ACL)
- **IntelliFin.CommunicationsService** - All notifications and communications (consolidated)
- **IntelliFin.ReportingService** - Reporting and compliance (consolidated)

### Desktop Applications
- **IntelliFin.Desktop.OfflineCenter** - .NET MAUI CEO Offline Command Center with offline data storage and synchronization capabilities

### Current Implementation (Granular Microservices)
