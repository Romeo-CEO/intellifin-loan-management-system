### Technical Constraints and Integration Notes

**Period Closing Integrity:**
- Once a period is closed, no changes can be made to that period
- Period closure must maintain financial data integrity
- Period reopening must be properly authorized and audited
- Period closure must follow established financial closing patterns

**Trial Balance Accuracy:**
- Trial balance must accurately reflect all account balances
- Trial balance validation must identify and report discrepancies
- Trial balance must be generated efficiently for multiple period types
- Trial balance must maintain audit trail for compliance

**Manual Adjustment Controls:**
- All manual adjustments must be properly authorized and audited
- Adjustment workflows must follow AdminService approval patterns
- Adjustment entries must maintain double-entry accounting integrity
- Adjustment audit trails must be comprehensive for compliance

**Period Management:**
- Period definitions must be configurable and flexible
- Period closing must handle multiple period types (daily, monthly, annual)
- Period status must be properly tracked and managed
- Period closing must integrate with existing financial workflows

### Integration Verification Points

**Existing Financial System Integrity:**
- TreasuryService period management continues without disruption
- Collections financial reconciliation maintains proper period integration
- AdminService approval workflows handle period closing authorizations
- Financial reporting includes accurate period-based financial data

**Period Closing Validation:**
- Period closing maintains financial data integrity and accuracy
- Trial balance generation produces accurate and complete balances
