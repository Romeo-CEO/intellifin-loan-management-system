## Dev Notes

### Technical Context from Architecture Documents

**Financial Project Structure Integration:**
- Follow existing .NET 9 microservice patterns from TreasuryService and FinancialService for financial operations
- Place FinancialAccountingService in `apps/IntelliFin.FinancialAccountingService/` directory structure
- Use Entity Framework Core patterns consistent with existing financial services [Source: financial-brownfield-architecture.md#source-tree-and-module-organization]

**Financial Database Integration:**
- Extend existing SQL Server database schema using Entity Framework migrations for financial accounting
- Follow established financial migration patterns from existing services
- Implement financial connection pooling and retry patterns from current infrastructure
- Use existing financial database backup and recovery procedures [Source: financial-brownfield-architecture.md#integration-points-and-service-dependencies]

**Financial Service Communication:**
- Use RabbitMQ event-driven architecture following TreasuryService financial patterns
- Implement MassTransit consumers for financial service integration
- Follow financial event ordering and deduplication patterns from existing services
- Use existing financial circuit breaker implementations for resilience [Source: financial-brownfield-architecture.md#event-driven-architecture]

**Financial Security Integration:**
