# Offline Origination Flow - Limelight Moneylink Services

## Executive Summary

This document defines the step-by-step offline loan origination process for loan officers when the LMS system is operating in offline mode. It provides clear procedures, risk controls, and documentation requirements to ensure compliant and secure offline lending operations while maintaining the dual-control security framework established by CEO authorization.

## Business Context

### Offline Mode Characteristics
- **Temporary Operation**: Offline mode is always temporary and requires reconnection
- **Controlled Risk**: Strict limits and dual-signature requirements prevent abuse
- **Manual Processes**: Paper-based workflow with digital capture when possible
- **Enhanced Audit**: Complete documentation and dual-control verification

### Offline Mode Triggers
- **System Outages**: LMS system unavailable for extended periods
- **Connectivity Issues**: Internet or network connectivity problems
- **Integration Failures**: PMEC, TransUnion, or other critical service failures
- **Emergency Maintenance**: Planned system maintenance requiring offline operations

## Pre-Offline Preparation

### 1. System Status Verification
**Offline Mode Confirmation**:
```
Required Checks:
- Verify offline mode is CEO-authorized
- Confirm current risk limits and restrictions
- Check offline mode duration remaining
- Verify available loan products for offline processing
- Confirm dual-signature requirements
```

**Risk Limit Awareness**:
```
Current Limits Display:
- Individual loan maximum amount
- Daily portfolio exposure limit
- Daily loan count limit
- Required collateral ratios
- Employment verification requirements
- Time restrictions
```

### 2. Documentation Preparation
**Required Forms and Materials**:
```
The primary tool for offline origination is the secure desktop application. Loan officers will be trained to have necessary physical checklists (e.g., NRC verification steps) as a procedural guide, but all data capture will happen directly within the application.

Supporting Materials:
- NRC verification checklist
- PMEC status verification form
- Collateral valuation worksheet
- Risk grade calculation sheet
- Compliance checklist
- Audit trail log
```
