# Sync and Reconciliation - Limelight Moneylink Services

## Executive Summary

This document defines the data synchronization and conflict resolution procedures for the LMS system when transitioning from offline mode back to online operations. It covers the complete process of uploading offline data, resolving conflicts, reconciling discrepancies, and ensuring data integrity while maintaining compliance and audit requirements.

## Business Context

### Why Sync and Reconciliation is Critical
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures offline and online data consistency
- **Compliance**: Maintains regulatory compliance during reconnection
- **Risk Management**: Prevents data loss and ensures accurate risk exposure
- **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation of all offline activities
- **Business Continuity**: Seamless transition back to normal operations

### Sync and Reconciliation Philosophy
- **Data Preservation**: No offline data is lost during synchronization
- **Conflict Resolution**: Clear rules for resolving data discrepancies
- **Audit Completeness**: Complete audit trail of all offline activities
- **Compliance Maintenance**: Regulatory compliance throughout the process
- **Quality Assurance**: Data validation and verification at every step

## Reconnection Process

### 1. System Restoration
**Reconnection Triggers**:
```
System Events:
- Primary system restoration
- Network connectivity restored
- Database access restored
- Integration services available
- Security systems operational
- All required services online

Business Events:
- CEO manually deactivates offline mode
- Risk limits exceeded
- Extended offline duration reached
- Compliance requirements triggered
- Emergency situation resolved
```

**System Health Checks**:
```
Required Checks:
- Database connectivity
- Integration service status
- Security system status
- Audit system status
- Risk management system
- Compliance monitoring
- Reporting system status
```

### 2. Reconnection Sequence
**Reconnection Order**:
```
The desktop application detects a stable internet connection.
It securely authenticates with the Offline Sync Service.
It sends a "sync handshake" with its last_sync_timestamp.
The server responds with a delta of any global changes (e.g., new product configs).
The desktop app then begins uploading its locally created records (clients, applications, vouchers) one by one to the Sync Service. Each record is processed and validated sequentially on the server before the next is sent. This ensures transactional integrity.

Priority Sequence:
1. Core database systems
2. Security and authentication
3. Risk management systems
4. Integration services (PMEC, TransUnion)
5. Payment systems (Tingg)
6. Reporting and compliance
7. Customer portal systems
8. Administrative systems
```

**Service Verification**:
```
Verification Requirements:
- Service availability confirmation
- Performance testing
- Security verification
- Integration testing
- Compliance verification
- Audit system verification
```

```

**Primary Conflict Resolution Rule: Unified Customer Profile**:
```
When syncing a new client created offline, the system's first action is to search the central database for a matching NRC.

If no match: A new global client profile is created.

If a match is found: The system will never create a duplicate. It will flag the offline application for a mandatory manual review, presenting the loan officer with the existing client profile and the new offline-captured data to merge and resolve.
```

```
Resolution Approaches:
- Data validation and correction
