# CEO Authorization for Offline Operations - Limelight Moneylink Services

## Executive Summary

This document defines the CEO's authority and process for enabling offline operations mode in the LMS system. Offline mode is a critical business continuity feature that allows loan origination to continue during system outages or connectivity issues, while maintaining strict risk controls and dual-control security measures.

## Business Context

### Why Offline Operations is Critical
- **Business Continuity**: Ensures lending operations continue during system outages
- **Competitive Advantage**: Unique capability that differentiates Limelight from competitors
- **Risk Management**: Controlled offline operations with strict limits and oversight
- **Customer Service**: Maintains service levels even during technical disruptions

### Offline Operations Philosophy
- **Controlled Risk**: Offline mode is not a free-for-all; it's a controlled, limited capability
- **Dual Control**: CEO authorization + Loan Officer execution with strict limits
- **Temporary Nature**: Offline mode is always temporary and requires reconnection
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all offline activities for reconciliation

## CEO Authorization Process

### 1. Authorization Triggers
**System Events Requiring CEO Authorization**:
```
Primary Triggers:
- LMS system outage exceeding 2 hours
- PMEC integration failure affecting loan processing
- Internet connectivity issues at branch locations
- Database connectivity problems
- Critical system maintenance requiring downtime

Secondary Triggers:
- Natural disasters affecting infrastructure
- Power grid failures
- Network security incidents
- Third-party service provider outages
```
