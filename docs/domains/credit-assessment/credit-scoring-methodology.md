# Credit Scoring Methodology - Limelight Moneylink Services

## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive credit scoring methodology for the Limelight Moneylink Services LMS system. It outlines the rules-based decision framework, risk assessment criteria, and scoring algorithms used to evaluate creditworthiness for both Government Employee Payroll Loans and SME Asset-Backed Loans, ensuring consistent, objective, and compliant credit decisions.

## Business Context

### Why Credit Scoring is Critical
- **Risk Management**: Systematic assessment of borrower creditworthiness
- **Decision Consistency**: Standardized approach to credit decisions
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Adherence to BoZ and Money Lenders Act requirements
- **Portfolio Quality**: Maintaining healthy loan portfolio performance
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated decision-making for faster processing

### Scoring Philosophy
- **Rules-Based**: Simple, configurable decision framework (A-F grades)
- **Transparent**: Clear criteria and decision logic
- **Risk-Focused**: Primary emphasis on repayment ability and risk factors
- **Compliant**: Built-in regulatory compliance and audit requirements
- **Adaptive**: Configurable parameters for different market conditions

## Credit Scoring Framework

### 1. Scoring Components
**Primary Scoring Factors**:
```
Core Factors:
- Credit Bureau Score (TransUnion)
- Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio
- Length of Employment/Time in Business
- Income Stability
- Collateral Quality (SME only)
- Payment History (existing customers)
```

**Secondary Scoring Factors**:
```
Supporting Factors:
- Age and experience
- Education level
- Marital status
- Number of dependents
- Banking relationship
- Geographic location
- Industry risk (SME)
```

### 2. Risk Grade System
**Risk Grade Categories**:
```
Risk Grades:
- Grade A: Excellent (Recommended for Approval)
- Grade B: Good (Recommended for Approval with Conditions)
- Grade C: Average (Manual Review Required)
- Grade D: Below Average (Recommended for Rejection - High Risk)
- Grade F: Poor (Recommended for Rejection - Critical Risk)
```

**Grade Interpretation**:
```
Grade Meanings:
- Grade A: Low risk, standard terms
- Grade B: Low-medium risk, standard terms with monitoring
- Grade C: Medium risk, enhanced terms or conditions
- Grade D: High risk, restrictive terms or rejection
- Grade F: Very high risk, automatic rejection
```

## Scoring Methodology

The system does not use a complex numerical score. Instead, it assigns a **'Calculated Risk Grade' (A, B, C, D, F)** based on a set of clear, configurable business rules.

### 1. Government Employee Payroll Loans
The Risk Grade is determined by rules based on three primary inputs:
- **Credit Bureau Score** (from TransUnion)
- **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio**
- **Length of Employment**

**Example Rules**:
```
IF Credit Score > 700 AND DTI < 35% AND Employment > 3 years THEN Risk Grade = A
IF Credit Score > 650 AND DTI < 40% AND Employment > 2 years THEN Risk Grade = B
IF Credit Score > 600 AND DTI < 50% AND Employment > 1 year THEN Risk Grade = C
IF Credit Score < 600 OR DTI > 50% OR Employment < 1 year THEN Risk Grade = D
IF Credit Score < 550 OR DTI > 60% THEN Risk Grade = F
```

### 2. SME Asset-Backed Loans
The Risk Grade is determined by rules based on four primary inputs:
- **Credit Bureau Score**
- **Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)** (more appropriate for businesses than DTI)
- **Time in Business**
- **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio** of the provided collateral.

**Example Rules**:
```
IF Credit Score > 700 AND DSCR > 1.5 AND Business > 3 years AND LTV < 60% THEN Risk Grade = A
IF Credit Score > 650 AND DSCR > 1.25 AND Business > 2 years AND LTV < 70% THEN Risk Grade = B
IF Credit Score > 600 AND DSCR > 1.0 AND Business > 1 year AND LTV < 80% THEN Risk Grade = C
IF LTV > 70% OR DSCR < 1.25 THEN Risk Grade = D
IF Credit Score < 550 OR DSCR < 1.0 OR LTV > 80% THEN Risk Grade = F
```

## Risk Assessment Criteria

### 1. Credit Bureau Integration
**TransUnion Integration**:
```
Integration Features:
- Real-time credit score retrieval
- Credit history analysis
- Payment behavior assessment
- Credit utilization analysis
- Recent credit inquiries
- Public records check
```

**Credit Score Interpretation**:
```
Score Ranges:
- 750-850: Excellent credit
- 700-749: Good credit
- 650-699: Fair credit
- 600-649: Poor credit
- 300-599: Very poor credit
```

### 2. Income Assessment
**Income Verification**:
```
Verification Methods:
- Salary slips (last 3 months)
- Bank statements
- Employment verification
- PMEC verification (Government employees)
- Business financial statements (SME)

```

**Income Stability Factors**:
```
Stability Indicators:

### 3. Debt Analysis
**Debt Assessment**:
```
Debt Components:

DTI Formula:
DTI = (Total Monthly Debt Payments / Gross Monthly Income) Ã— 100

DTI Thresholds:
- 0-30%: Low risk
- 31-40%: Medium risk
- 41-50%: High risk

```
