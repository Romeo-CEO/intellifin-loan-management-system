## Story Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Stories 1.1-1.2)
Establish service infrastructure and database schema enhancements.

### Phase 2: Core Logic Migration (Stories 1.3-1.4)
Create API and migrate existing assessment logic with functional parity.

### Phase 3: External Integrations (Stories 1.5-1.7)
Integrate with Client Management, TransUnion, and PMEC services.

### Phase 4: Configuration & Rules (Stories 1.8-1.9)
Implement Vault-based configuration and dynamic rule engine.

### Phase 5: Events & Audit (Stories 1.10-1.13)
Add explainability, audit trail, KYC monitoring, and manual overrides.

### Phase 6: Workflow Integration (Stories 1.14-1.20)
Camunda integration, feature flags, optimization, testing, monitoring, and production deployment.

## Development Guidelines

### Story File Naming Convention
- Format: `{epic}.{story}.{short-title}.md`
- Example: `1.1.service-scaffolding.md`

### Story Structure
Each story file includes:
- **Status**: Draft | Approved | InProgress | Review | Done
- **Story**: User story in "As a...I want...so that..." format
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Numbered list from PRD
- **Tasks / Subtasks**: Detailed implementation checklist
- **Dev Notes**: Technical context extracted from architecture docs with source references
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and manual testing guidance
- **Change Log**: Version history
- **Dev Agent Record**: Populated during implementation
- **QA Results**: Populated during QA review

### Source References
All technical details in Dev Notes MUST include source references:
- `[Source: docs/domains/credit-assessment/prd.md#{section}]`
- `[Source: docs/domains/credit-assessment/brownfield-architecture.md#{section}]`

### Integration Verification
Each story includes Integration Verification (IV) requirements ensuring:
- Backward compatibility with existing services
- No breaking changes during migration
- Performance and quality standards met

## Key Technical Patterns

### Resilience Patterns
- Circuit breakers for external API calls (Polly)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation to manual review
- Health checks for dependencies

### Configuration Management
- Vault-based rule configuration
- Configuration versioning and audit
- Hot reload without service restart
- Last-known-good fallback

### Event-Driven Architecture
- RabbitMQ for KYC status events
- Idempotent event handlers
- Dead letter queues for failed processing
- Event correlation with assessments

### Audit and Compliance
- Complete decision traceability to AdminService
- Structured audit events for all operations
- Configuration version tracking
- Manual override documentation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- All business logic covered
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Testing
- External service client tests
- Database repository tests
- Event handler tests
- End-to-end assessment flow

### Performance Testing
- 100 concurrent assessments
- Sustained 100 req/sec load
- p95 latency < 5 seconds
- Cache hit rate > 70%

### Migration Testing
- Backward compatibility validation
- Feature flag gradual rollout
- Zero-downtime deployment
- Rollback procedure validation

## Success Criteria

**Phase Completion**: Each phase complete when all stories in that phase are "Done"

**Epic Completion**: When all 20 stories reach "Done" status and production deployment successful

**Quality Gates**:
- ✓ All tests passing (unit + integration)
- ✓ Code coverage > 80%
- ✓ Performance SLAs met
- ✓ Security review passed
- ✓ Documentation complete
- ✓ Backward compatibility verified

## Getting Started

1. Review PRD: `docs/domains/credit-assessment/prd.md`
2. Review Architecture: `docs/domains/credit-assessment/brownfield-architecture.md`
3. Start with Story 1.1 (Service Scaffolding)
4. Follow sequential order within each phase
5. Mark stories "InProgress" when starting work
6. Update Dev Agent Record during implementation
7. Mark stories "Done" when all AC met and tests pass
