- **Vault-based rule configuration** with hot-reload capabilities
- **TransUnion credit bureau integration** with smart routing and fallback
- **PMEC government employee verification** and payroll integration
- **Client Management API integration** for KYC and employment data
- **Camunda workflow integration** with external task workers
- **Decision explainability** with human-readable reasoning
- **Comprehensive audit trails** via AdminService
- **Event-driven KYC monitoring** with assessment invalidation
- **Manual override workflows** for credit officers
- **Feature flag implementation** for gradual migration
- **Performance optimization** with caching strategies

## Current State Assessment

**Location:** `apps/IntelliFin.LoanOriginationService/` (embedded logic)

**Current Implementation:**
- Credit assessment logic embedded in Loan Origination Service
- Basic scoring in `CreditAssessmentService.cs`
- Hard-coded risk rules in `RiskCalculationEngine.cs`
- DMN decision table for risk grading (A-F)
- Mocked TransUnion integration (not production-ready)
- Limited audit trail capabilities
- No event-driven KYC monitoring
- Basic affordability analysis without deep PMEC integration

**To be extracted and enhanced:**
- Core assessment logic migration with functional parity
- New microservice: `apps/IntelliFin.CreditAssessmentService/`
- Vault-based configuration management
- Production-ready TransUnion integration
- Comprehensive audit and monitoring
- Event-driven architecture with RabbitMQ
- Camunda workflow integration

## Implementation Guidelines

### 📋 **Before You Start Each Story:**
1. Read the full story file in `docs/domains/credit-assessment/stories/`
2. Review acceptance criteria and dependencies
3. Check previous story completion status
4. Review brownfield architecture document for context

### 🔨 **During Implementation:**
1. Follow existing IntelliFin patterns and conventions
2. Enable nullable reference types
3. Add XML comments on public APIs
4. Use FluentValidation for input validation
5. Log all operations with correlation IDs
6. Add health checks for external dependencies
7. Implement circuit breakers for external APIs
8. Use feature flags for gradual rollout

### ✅ **After Implementation:**
1. Run `dotnet build` - verify 0 errors
2. Run `dotnet test` - all tests pass
3. Verify integration tests with TestContainers
4. Test health check endpoints
5. Execute Integration Verification (IV) steps from story
6. Commit with clear message
7. Update story status to "Done"

## Handoff Notes for Next Developer

### What's Ready:
- **20 comprehensive stories** covering the complete Credit Assessment microservice
- **Detailed technical specifications** in PRD and Architecture documents
- **Clear implementation order** with dependency mapping
- **Comprehensive testing strategy** with coverage targets
- **Migration plan** for gradual cutover from embedded logic

### What's Next (Story 1.1):
**Goal:** Create the Credit Assessment Service project structure with deployment configuration

**Tasks:**
1. Create new ASP.NET Core 8.0 project `IntelliFin.CreditAssessmentService`
2. Configure dependency injection with Serilog, Prometheus, health checks
3. Create Dockerfile with multi-stage build
4. Create Kubernetes deployment manifest and Helm chart
5. Implement health check endpoints (`/health/live`, `/health/ready`)
6. Add Prometheus metrics endpoint (`/metrics`)
7. Successfully deploy to development Kubernetes cluster

**Key Files to Create:**
- `apps/IntelliFin.CreditAssessmentService/Program.cs`
- `apps/IntelliFin.CreditAssessmentService/Dockerfile`
- `apps/IntelliFin.CreditAssessmentService/k8s/deployment.yaml`
- `apps/IntelliFin.CreditAssessmentService/k8s/helm/Chart.yaml`

**Reference:**
- Story documentation: `docs/domains/credit-assessment/stories/1.1.service-scaffolding.md`
- Existing service patterns: Check `IntelliFin.LoanOriginationService` for reference

**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 hours

### Tips for Continuation:

1. **Follow Established Patterns:** Review existing services for DI, middleware, and configuration patterns
2. **Use Existing Infrastructure:** Leverage shared libraries and common infrastructure components
3. **Test Early:** Set up TestContainers from the beginning for integration testing
4. **Monitor Everything:** Implement comprehensive logging and metrics from Story 1.1
5. **Plan for Migration:** Keep feature flags in mind for gradual cutover from embedded logic

### Build & Test Commands:

```bash
# Build solution
dotnet build

# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run integration tests only
dotnet test --filter "Category=Integration"

# Run the service locally
cd apps/IntelliFin.CreditAssessmentService
dotnet run
```

### Key Success Factors:

- **Start Simple:** Focus on getting the basic service running before adding complex features
- **Test Continuously:** Implement tests as you build, not after
- **Document Decisions:** Keep track of architectural decisions and trade-offs
- **Plan for Scale:** Design for the performance targets from the beginning
- **Security First:** Implement security patterns early in the development process
