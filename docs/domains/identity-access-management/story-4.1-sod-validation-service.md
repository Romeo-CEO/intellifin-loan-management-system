# Story 4.1: SoD Validation Service

## Status
Completed âœ…

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] AC1: `ValidateRoleAssignmentAsync` blocks (strict) or warns (warning) on conflicts derived from active `SoDRules`.
- [x] AC2: `DetectViolationsAsync` returns a report of users currently violating SoD policies.
- [x] AC3: Violations are audited with actionable metadata (rule, permissions, user, attempted role).
- [x] AC4: Validation queries instrumented and optimized for < 100ms typical execution via filtered EF Core queries.

## Implementation Tasks
- [x] Model SoD configuration with new `SoDRule` entity, enum, DbContext mappings, and migration snapshot updates.
- [x] Introduce SoD validation models (`SoDValidationResult`, `SoDViolationReport`, etc.) and `ISoDValidationService` contract.
- [x] Implement `SoDValidationService` with permission aggregation, rule evaluation, auditing, and violation detection logic.
- [x] Integrate SoD validation with `UserService.AssignRoleAsync` plus REST controllers to surface conflicts and warnings.
- [x] Register the service in DI and add unit tests covering strict blocks, warning paths, and violation detection.

## Developer Notes
- Reviewed the existing `apps/IntelliFin.IdentityService` implementation, focusing on `UserService`, repositories, and role assignment flows to align the new validation service with current architecture.
- Added a persistent `SoDRule` entity since no prior schema existed; updated `LmsDbContext` and the EF Core model snapshot manually to reflect the new table.
- Integrated SoD enforcement at the `UserService` level because the existing `RoleService` is an in-memory stub and does not mediate database-backed role assignments.
- Controllers now differentiate between blocked conflicts (409), warning scenarios, and persistence failures so admins receive actionable responses.
- Attempted to locate the referenced IAM architecture documents (`iam-brownfield-assessment.md`, `iam-enhancement-architecture.md`, `iam-enhancement-prd.md`, `iam_migration.sql`), but they are still absent from the repository; implementation proceeded using the available service codebase context.
