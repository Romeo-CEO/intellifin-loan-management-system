## Common Issues

### **"I don't see the integration branch"**
```bash
git fetch --all
git checkout feature/iam-remaining-work
```

### **"My story file is missing"**
Check you're in the stories subdirectory:
```bash
ls docs/domains/identity-access-management/stories/
```

### **"Build fails with missing dependencies"**
```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

### **"Tests fail in existing code"**
This is normal - there are pre-existing issues. Focus on making sure YOUR new tests pass and you don't introduce NEW failures.
