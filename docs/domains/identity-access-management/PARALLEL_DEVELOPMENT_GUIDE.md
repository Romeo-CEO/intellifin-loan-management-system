# IAM Parallel Development Guide

**Integration Branch:** `feature/iam-remaining-work`  
**Created:** 2025-10-17  
**Status:** Active  
**Target Completion:** 3-4 weeks

## Overview

This guide coordinates parallel development for the 4 remaining IAM stories across multiple AI agents. The integration branch strategy prevents merge conflicts and enables independent work.

## Daily Workflow

### **Morning Routine (9:00 AM)**

Each agent:
1. Check integration branch for new merges
2. Update your feature branch if changes affect your work

```bash
git checkout feature/iam-remaining-work
git pull origin feature/iam-remaining-work

git checkout feature/story-X.X-your-story
git merge feature/iam-remaining-work
# Resolve conflicts if any
```

---

### **End of Day Routine (5:00 PM)**

When story is complete:
1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Push your feature branch
3. Create PR to integration branch
4. Notify other agents in Slack/Discord

```bash
# Commit your work
git add .
git commit -m "feat(story-X.X): Description of changes"

# Push to your feature branch
git push origin feature/story-X.X-your-story

# Create PR on GitHub
# Target: feature/iam-remaining-work
# Reviewers: Orchestrator + Other agents (optional)
```

---

## Merge Strategy

### **Story Completion Checklist**

Before creating PR, verify:
- [ ] All story Acceptance Criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests pass (`dotnet test`)
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing code
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns
- [ ] No TODO comments without tracking issue
- [ ] Updated IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md

### **PR Merge Order**

**Priority 1 (Blockers):**
- Story 1.7 (blocks 6.1 - migration needs baseline roles)

**Priority 2 (Independent):**
- Story 2.2 (independent - can merge anytime)
- Story 5.1 (ongoing - can merge as tests are added)

**Priority 3 (Final features):**
- Story 6.1 (after 1.7 complete)
- Story 6.2 (can run parallel with 6.1)

### **Merge Process**

1. **Orchestrator reviews PR**
2. **Automated checks pass** (if CI/CD configured)
3. **Merge to integration branch** using "Squash and Merge" or "Merge Commit"
4. **Update IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md** - mark story as ‚úÖ COMPLETE
5. **Notify all agents** that integration branch has been updated

---

## Conflict Resolution Protocol

### **If you encounter merge conflicts:**

1. **DO NOT force push** - You'll lose work
2. **Communicate with other agent** who modified the same file
3. **Resolve conflicts manually**:

```bash
git checkout feature/iam-remaining-work
git pull origin feature/iam-remaining-work
git checkout feature/story-X.X-your-story
git merge feature/iam-remaining-work

# Git will show conflicts
# Edit conflicted files manually
# Choose the correct code

git add <resolved-files>
git commit -m "fix: Resolve merge conflicts with integration branch"
git push origin feature/story-X.X-your-story
```

4. **If uncertain**, pause and ask orchestrator

### **Shared File Coordination**

**These files may be touched by multiple agents:**

| File | Primary Owner | Rule |
|------|--------------|------|
| `ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` | Agent A | Add TODO comments for other agents |
| `appsettings.json` | Agent A | Document config keys in PR |
| `Program.cs` | Agent A | Coordinate startup logic changes |
| `LmsDbContext.cs` | Agent A | No changes expected (schema complete) |

**Protocol for shared files:**
1. Add comment: `// TODO: [Agent-B] Add your service registration here after Story X.X`
2. Other agent fills in TODO when their story is ready
3. Remove TODO comment after completion

---

## Testing Gates

### **Before Merging to Integration Branch**

Each story MUST pass:

1. ‚úÖ **Unit Tests**: All new code has unit tests
   ```bash
   dotnet test tests/IntelliFin.IdentityService.Tests/
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **Integration Tests**: If story adds API endpoints
   ```bash
   dotnet test tests/IntelliFin.Tests.Integration/
   ```

3. ‚úÖ **Manual Testing**: Test the feature end-to-end
   - Use Postman/curl to test API endpoints
   - Verify database changes
   - Check logs for errors

4. ‚úÖ **No Regressions**: Existing tests still pass
   ```bash
   dotnet test --no-build
   ```

---

## Communication Protocol

### **Slack/Discord Channels**

- **#iam-coordination**: Daily updates, merge notifications
- **#iam-blockers**: Report any blockers immediately
- **#iam-questions**: Technical questions, clarifications

### **Daily Standup (Async - Posted by 10 AM)**

Each agent posts:
```
Agent: [Your Name]
Story: [X.X - Story Name]
Status: [In Progress/Blocked/Complete]
Today's Plan: [What you'll work on]
Blockers: [Any issues preventing progress]
```

### **Merge Notification (Required)**

When you merge to integration:
```
üéâ Story X.X Merged!
Branch: feature/story-X.X-name -> feature/iam-remaining-work
Changes: [Brief description]
Impact: [Which files changed that others might depend on]
Next: [What you're working on next]
```

## Troubleshooting

### **"My branch is behind integration branch"**
```bash
git checkout feature/story-X.X-your-story
git merge feature/iam-remaining-work
git push origin feature/story-X.X-your-story
```

### **"I accidentally committed to integration branch"**
```bash
# DON'T PANIC! Reset your changes
git checkout feature/iam-remaining-work
git reset --hard origin/feature/iam-remaining-work

# Recreate your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/story-X.X-your-story
# Cherry-pick your commits if needed
```

### **"Another agent's changes broke my code"**
1. Identify the breaking change
2. Message the agent in #iam-coordination
3. Discuss solution (they fix or you adapt)
4. Update your code accordingly
