# Introduction

This document outlines the architectural approach for enhancing **IntelliFin.Communications** with comprehensive SMS provider migration to Africa's Talking, database persistence implementation, business event processing completion, and template management system. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development while ensuring seamless integration with the existing microservice architecture.

**Relationship to Existing Architecture:**
This document supplements the existing IntelliFin microservices architecture by defining how the enhanced Communications service will integrate with the current SQL Server Always On infrastructure, Redis caching layer, and MassTransit message bus.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

**Brownfield Enhancement** - This is an enhancement of the existing `IntelliFin.Communications` service with comprehensive new features while maintaining backward compatibility and integrating with the established IntelliFin ecosystem.

**Current State Analysis:**
The existing `IntelliFin.Communications` service provides basic email functionality but lacks comprehensive SMS integration, database persistence for audit trails, business event processing, and template management capabilities required for regulatory compliance and operational efficiency.
