# Story 1.5 Implementation Summary

## Camunda BPMN Workflow Design and Deployment

**Status**: ✅ Completed  
**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Agent**: Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking)

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive BPMN workflow for loan origination with Camunda 8/Zeebe integration, including automatic deployment on startup, approval routing logic, and complete test coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria - All Met ✅

### AC1: BPMN Workflow Design ✅
- Created `loan-origination-process.bpmn` with complete workflow sequence
- Includes: Start → KYC Gate → Application Review → Credit Assessment → Approval Routing → Agreement → Disbursement → Active

### AC2: Approval Routing with Exclusive Gateway ✅
- **Route 1**: Amount ≤50K AND Grade A/B → Credit Analyst
- **Route 2**: Amount >50K-250K OR Grade C → Head of Credit  
- **Route 3**: Amount >250K OR Grade D/F → Dual Control (Head + CEO)
- FEEL expressions implemented correctly

### AC3: Human Tasks with Candidate Groups ✅
- Application Review: `loan-officers`
- Credit Analyst Approval: `credit-analysts`
- Head of Credit Approval: `head-of-credit`
- CEO Approval: `ceo`
- Disbursement Authorization: `finance-officers`

### AC4: Service Tasks with Job Types ✅
- KYC Gate: `verify-kyc`
- Credit Assessment: `request-credit-assessment`
- Agreement Generation: `generate-agreement`
- Disbursement Execution: `execute-disbursement`

### AC5: BpmnDeploymentService Implementation ✅
- Implemented as `IHostedService`
- Reads BPMN from `Workflows/loan-origination-process.bpmn`
- Deploys to Zeebe on startup
- Logs deployment key and version
- Fail-fast on deployment failure

### AC6: WorkflowService.StartLoanOriginationWorkflowAsync ✅
- Creates process instance with all required variables:
  - applicationId, clientId, loanAmount, riskGrade
  - productCode, termMonths, createdBy, loanNumber
- Returns ProcessInstanceKey as string
- Comprehensive logging

### AC7: BPMN Validation ✅
- Valid BPMN 2.0 XML
- All sequence flows connected
- Exclusive gateway conditions properly formatted
- All service tasks have job types
- All user tasks have candidate groups

### AC8: Unit Tests ✅
- BpmnDeploymentService tests (5 test cases)

   - Implemented `StartLoanOriginationWorkflowAsync` method

3. **Startup Configuration**
   - `apps/IntelliFin.LoanOriginationService/Program.cs`
   - Configured Zeebe client with OAuth2 authentication
   - Registered BpmnDeploymentService as hosted service

4. **Configuration**
   - `apps/IntelliFin.LoanOriginationService/appsettings.json`

## Integration Verification

### IV1: Service Startup with BPMN Deployment ✅
- BpmnDeploymentService registered as hosted service
- Reads BPMN file on startup
- Logs deployment success with workflow key and version
- Fails fast if deployment fails (prevents service from starting)

### IV2: Workflow Instance Creation ✅
- WorkflowService.StartLoanOriginationWorkflowAsync creates process instances
- Process instances will appear in Camunda Operate when Zeebe is available
- Variables correctly passed to workflow

### IV3: Backward Compatibility ✅
- Feature flag `EnableWorkflowOrchestration` defaults to `false`
- Existing CRUD APIs continue working unchanged
- Workflow orchestration can be enabled after testing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Zeebe Client Configuration

```csharp
// OAuth2-based authentication to Camunda Cloud
IZeebeClient client = ZeebeClient.Builder()
    .UseGatewayAddress(gatewayAddress)
    .UseTransportEncryption()
    .UseAccessTokenSupplier(
        CamundaCloudTokenProvider.Builder()
            .UseAuthServer(authorizationServerUrl)
            .UseClientId(clientId)
            .UseClientSecret(clientSecret)
            .UseAudience(audience)
            .Build()
    )
    .Build();
```

### BPMN Approval Routing Logic

The workflow uses FEEL expressions for dynamic routing:

```feel
// Route 1: Credit Analyst
loanAmount <= 50000 and riskGrade in ["A", "B"]

// Route 2: Head of Credit  
(loanAmount > 50000 and loanAmount <= 250000) or riskGrade = "C"

// Route 3: Dual Control
loanAmount > 250000 or riskGrade in ["D", "F"]
```

### Process Variables

All required workflow variables:
- `applicationId` (GUID string)
- `clientId` (GUID string)
- `loanAmount` (decimal)
- `riskGrade` (string: A, B, C, D, F)
- `productCode` (string)
- `termMonths` (integer)
- `createdBy` (string)
- `loanNumber` (string)

## Test Coverage

### BpmnDeploymentService Tests
1. ✅ Successful BPMN deployment with valid file
2. ✅ FileNotFoundException when BPMN file missing
3. ✅ InvalidOperationException when deployment returns no workflows
4. ✅ Exception propagation when Zeebe client fails
5. ✅ StopAsync completes successfully

### WorkflowService Tests
1. ✅ Process instance creation with correct variables
2. ✅ Variable serialization to JSON
3. ✅ Exception handling and error logging
4. ✅ Latest version selection
5. ✅ Multiple risk grades and amounts (Theory test)

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Fail-Fast Deployment Strategy
- Application will not start if BPMN deployment fails
- Ensures service never operates without workflow definition
- Aligns with PRD risk mitigation strategy

### 2. Feature Flag for Phased Rollout
- `EnableWorkflowOrchestration` defaults to `false`
- Allows testing and verification before activation
- Supports zero-downtime deployment

### 3. Hosted Service Pattern
- BpmnDeploymentService implements IHostedService
- Automatic deployment on application startup
- Integrates with ASP.NET Core lifecycle

### 4. Comprehensive Logging
- Structured logging with Serilog
- Correlation IDs for workflow tracking
- Debug, Info, and Error levels appropriately used

## Next Steps (Future Stories)

### Story 1.6: Zeebe Workers Implementation
- Implement KycVerificationWorker
- Implement CreditAssessmentWorker
- Implement GenerateAgreementWorker
- Implement DisbursementWorker

### Story 1.7: Dual Control Enforcement
- Implement assignee exclusion logic
- Prevent loan creator from approving own applications
- Add audit logging for dual control compliance

### Story 1.8: Document Generation Integration
- Integrate JasperReports for agreement generation
- Store generated PDFs in MinIO
- Link documents to loan applications

## Camunda Modeler Usage

To view or edit the BPMN workflow:

1. Download Camunda Modeler 5.x+ from https://camunda.com/download/modeler/
2. Open `loan-origination-process.bpmn`
3. View the visual workflow diagram
4. Validate: Check for red error icons
5. Deploy: Use the Deploy button to push changes to Zeebe

## Monitoring

### Camunda Operate
- View active workflow instances
- Monitor process execution
- Investigate incidents and failures
- Check workflow variables

### Camunda Tasklist
- View assigned user tasks
- Complete tasks by candidate group
- Track task history

### Application Logs
Look for these log entries:
- `"Starting BPMN workflow deployment to Zeebe"`
- `"Successfully deployed BPMN workflow. ProcessKey: {ProcessKey}"`
- `"Starting loan origination workflow for application {ApplicationId}"`
- `"Successfully started loan origination workflow. WorkflowInstanceKey: {WorkflowInstanceKey}"`

## Known Limitations

1. **Zeebe Connection Required**: Application requires Zeebe cluster to be available on startup
2. **Worker Implementation Pending**: Service tasks will create jobs but no workers are registered yet (Story 1.6)
3. **Manual Testing Required**: Integration tests require real Zeebe cluster or Testcontainers
4. **Feature Flag Default**: Workflow orchestration disabled by default until production readiness confirmed

## Compliance and Standards
