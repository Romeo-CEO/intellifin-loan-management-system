## Disbursement Process Overview

### High-Level Process Flow
```
Loan Approved → Pre-Disbursement Check (System) → Finance Officer Authorization → Payment Execution (System) → GL Posting & Loan Activation (System)
```

### Process Stages
1. **Automated Pre-Disbursement Check** (System Verification)
2. **Disbursement Authorization & Execution** (Finance Officer Action)
3. **Automated Post-Disbursement Processing** (System Reaction)

## Stage 1: Automated Pre-Disbursement Check

### 1.1 System-Initiated Verification
**Automated Process**:
```
When a loan's status becomes 'Approved,' it enters the disbursement queue. Before it is presented to a Finance Officer, the system must perform a final, automated, non-bypassable pre-disbursement check.
```

**System Actions**:
```
Condition Validation: The system re-verifies that all approval conditions have been met:
- Required documents are in a "Verified" state
- Collateral is linked (if applicable)
- Insurance coverage is confirmed
- Guarantor requirements are met
- PMEC registration is completed (government loans)
- Business verification is completed (SME loans)

Compliance Re-Check (Critical): The system performs a final, real-time check against:
- Critical watchlists
- Internal blacklists
- Any issues that may have arisen since initial approval

Account Verification: The system confirms the client's disbursement details:
- Mobile money number (Tingg integration)
- Bank account details (bank transfer)
- Cash disbursement preferences
- Payment method validation
```

### 1.2 System Outcomes
**Check Results**:
```
If all checks pass:
- The loan status changes to "Ready for Disbursement"
- It appears in the Finance Officer's queue
- System logs all verification results

If any check fails:
- The loan status changes to "Disbursement Hold"
- It is flagged for immediate review by compliance or credit team
- System generates detailed failure report
- Manual intervention required before proceeding
```

## Stage 2: Disbursement Authorization & Execution

### 2.1 Finance Officer Queue Management
**Queue Presentation**:
```
Loans in the 'Ready for Disbursement' state appear in the Finance Officer's queue.

The UI clearly shows:
- Client information and loan details
- Approved loan amount
- Pre-selected disbursement method (Tingg, Bank, Cash, PMEC)
- All verification results from Stage 1
- Payment provider integration status
```

### 2.2 Finance Officer Authorization
**Authorization Process**:
```
Finance Officer's Task: The officer selects one or more loans for disbursement. Their job is to:
- Perform a final sanity check of the information
- Provide the final authorization for fund release
- Verify payment method selection is appropriate
- Confirm disbursement timing

Dual Control (for large amounts): For disbursements over ZMW 100,000, the system enforces dual control:
- A second, senior finance manager must provide co-signing approval
- Both approvals must be within the system before payment execution
- System prevents bypass of dual control requirement
```

### 2.3 Payment Execution
**System Payment Processing**:
```
Once authorized, the Finance Officer clicks "Execute Disbursement." The Payment Processing Service then takes over:

Payment Provider Integration:
- Makes secure, resilient API call to the correct payment provider
- Tingg API for mobile money transfers
- Bank-specific API for bank transfers
- PMEC integration for government payroll deductions
- Cash disbursement system for branch operations

Security Measures:
- Uses idempotency key to prevent duplicate processing
- Encrypted communication with payment providers
- Real-time transaction monitoring
- Awaits definitive success or failure response from gateway
```

## Stage 3: Automated Post-Disbursement Processing

### 3.1 Event-Driven System Reactions
**Success Event Processing**:
```
Upon receiving a definitive success confirmation from the payment gateway, the Payment Processing Service publishes a LoanDisbursed event.

System Reactions (subscribers to the event):

General Ledger Service:
- Consumes the event and automatically creates immutable journal entry
- Debit: Loans Receivable
- Credit: Cash/Bank (based on payment method)
- Posts to appropriate cost centers and GL accounts
- Generates audit trail for all accounting entries

Loan Servicing Service:
- Changes the loan's status to "Active"
- Generates the final repayment schedule
- Sets up monitoring and alerting systems
- Activates customer portal access

Communications Service:
- Sends automated SMS to client confirming funds have been sent
- Provides payment details and next steps
- Sets up customer communication preferences
```

### 3.2 Error Handling and Recovery
**Payment Failure Scenarios**:
```
Payment Failures:
- Insufficient funds at payment provider
- Account validation failures
- Integration API errors
- Network connectivity issues
- Compliance violations

System Response:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Fallback to alternative payment methods
- Immediate notification to Finance Officer
- System logs all failure details
- Customer communication about delay
```
