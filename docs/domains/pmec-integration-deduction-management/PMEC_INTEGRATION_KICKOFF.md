# PMEC Integration & Deduction Management Module - Implementation Kickoff

**Date:** 2025-01-27
**Branch:** `feature/pmec-integration`
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready to Begin
**Current State:** No existing implementation (new microservice required)

---

## Executive Summary

You're about to build the **automated government payroll interface** of IntelliFin - the PMEC Integration & Deduction Management module that transforms the currently manual PMEC process into a fully automated, government-compliant system.

### What You're Building:
- **Automated PMEC lifecycle** from deduction schedule generation to reconciliation
- **Government-grade security** with mTLS, digital signatures, and comprehensive audit trails
- **Advanced reconciliation engine** with fuzzy matching and manual exception handling
- **Future-ready architecture** supporting both file-based and API integration
- **BoZ regulatory compliance** with complete government audit trails
- **Government payroll automation** eliminating manual CSV files and CD delivery

This module will become the **automated bridge** between IntelliFin and the government payroll system, ensuring every PMEC operation goes through proper validation, maintains accurate reconciliation, and provides the comprehensive audit trails required for government compliance.
