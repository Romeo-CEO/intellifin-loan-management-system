#### Enhancement Description

The PMEC Integration & Deduction Management module will become the automated bridge between IntelliFin and the government payroll system, managing the entire payroll deduction lifecycle from schedule generation to reconciliation. The enhancement adds a dedicated PMECService microservice that automates the currently manual PMEC process while maintaining full government compliance and audit trails.

#### Impact Assessment
✅ **Significant Impact** - New microservice requiring substantial integration with existing government data processing
✅ **Moderate Impact** - Extension of existing Camunda workflows and reconciliation processes
✅ **Major Impact** - New government data processing requiring enhanced security and compliance

#### Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
- Automate the entire PMEC payroll deduction lifecycle from generation to reconciliation
- Implement government-grade security and audit trails for all PMEC operations
- Create future-ready architecture for PMEC API integration when available
- Ensure 99%+ accuracy in PMEC reconciliation with comprehensive exception handling
- Maintain full BoZ compliance for government financial operations
- Provide complete audit trails for regulatory examination and compliance

**Background Context:**

The PMEC Integration & Deduction Management module addresses the critical need for automated government payroll deduction processing in IntelliFin's lending operations. Currently, PMEC submissions are handled through manual CSV/TXT file generation, physical CD delivery, and email response processing, creating operational risks, delays, and limited auditability.

This enhancement creates the missing automated layer that ensures every PMEC operation goes through proper validation, maintains accurate reconciliation, and provides the comprehensive audit trails required for government compliance. The module is designed to be both operationally efficient (automating current manual processes) and future-ready (supporting PMEC API integration when available).

**CRITICAL VALIDATION REQUESTED:**

Based on my analysis of your existing IntelliFin system and the comprehensive PMEC requirements you've provided, I understand that:

1. **Current State**: IntelliFin has basic PMEC integration in CollectionsService but relies on manual file processing and lacks comprehensive audit trails
2. **Missing Component**: No automated PMEC lifecycle management, reconciliation engine, or government-grade security for PMEC operations
3. **Integration Scope**: PMECService must integrate with Client Management (employee data), Loan Origination (loan schedules), Collections (repayments), Treasury (reconciliation), AdminService (government audit)
4. **Risk Level**: High-risk government data processing requiring enhanced security, digital signatures, and comprehensive audit trails
5. **Future Requirements**: Must be designed offline-first but API-ready for PMEC modernization

**Is this understanding correct? Please confirm before I proceed with the detailed requirements.**

## Epic and Story Structure

**Based on my analysis of your existing IntelliFin project, I believe this PMEC Integration & Deduction Management enhancement should be structured as a SINGLE COMPREHENSIVE EPIC because:**

1. **Cohesive Government Process**: All PMEC operations (deduction generation, file submission, feedback processing, reconciliation) are tightly interconnected and serve the same government payroll deduction purpose
2. **Integration Dependencies**: The PMECService must integrate with 5+ existing services in a coordinated manner - splitting this would create unnecessary complexity and compliance risks
3. **Government Compliance Requirements**: PMEC operations must maintain consistent security, audit trails, and compliance standards across all components
4. **Brownfield Integration**: Following established IntelliFin patterns, significant government enhancements like this are typically delivered as single epics with multiple sequential stories
5. **Risk Management**: Single epic allows for controlled rollout of government financial operations while maintaining data integrity and compliance

**Does this single epic approach align with your understanding of the PMEC enhancement scope?**
