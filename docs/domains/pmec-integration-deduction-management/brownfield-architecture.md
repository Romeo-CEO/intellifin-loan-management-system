- Separation allows specialized security and compliance implementation
- Enables clean integration with multiple services without disrupting Collections
- Supports future PMEC API integration without affecting existing reconciliation

### 2. File-Based Integration with API Readiness

**Decision**: Offline-first design with API-ready architecture

**Rationale**:
- Current PMEC process requires file-based integration
- Must be ready for future API integration when PMEC modernizes
- Modular design allows easy transition from files to APIs
- Maintains government compliance during transition

### 3. Enhanced Security for Government Data

**Decision**: Implement government-grade security beyond standard patterns

**Rationale**:
- Government payroll data requires enhanced security measures
- Must comply with government data protection regulations
- Digital signatures and WORM retention required for audit compliance
- Enhanced audit trails needed for regulatory examination

### 4. Advanced Reconciliation Engine

**Decision**: Build specialized reconciliation for PMEC data quality issues

**Rationale**:
- PMEC data formats are inconsistent and error-prone
- Government payments require high accuracy reconciliation
- Manual exception handling required for compliance
- Must handle partial payments and various rejection scenarios

## Conclusion

The PMEC Integration & Deduction Management module represents a strategic enhancement to IntelliFin's government lending capabilities, extending existing patterns while adding comprehensive government payroll automation. The brownfield approach ensures safe integration with the current microservices ecosystem while establishing PMEC as the automated bridge between IntelliFin and government payroll systems.

**Key Integration Success Factors:**
1. Follow established Camunda workflow patterns from ClientManagement and LoanOrigination
2. Extend CollectionsService reconciliation patterns for PMEC-specific workflows
3. Leverage AdminService audit and approval patterns for government compliance
4. Maintain existing event-driven architecture for service communication
5. Ensure government security compliance through enhanced Vault and audit integration

The PMECService will become the automated interface for government payroll deductions, ensuring accurate processing while maintaining complete auditability and regulatory compliance for government financial operations.
