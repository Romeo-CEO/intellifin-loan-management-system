- Storage integration must follow existing MinIO patterns

### Integration Verification Points

**Existing System Integrity:**
- AdminService approval workflows handle expense dual control correctly
- FinancialService expense posting patterns are properly extended
- CommunicationsService notification delivery remains reliable
- Collections EOD processes continue without Treasury interference
- ClientManagement branch operations unaffected by expense processing

**Financial Control Validation:**
