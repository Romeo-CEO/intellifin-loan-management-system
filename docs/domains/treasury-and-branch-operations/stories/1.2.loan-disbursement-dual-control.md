# Story 1.2: Loan Disbursement Processing and Dual Control

## Status: Draft

## Story

**As a treasury officer,**  
**I want to process loan disbursements through TreasuryService with dual authorization,**  
**so that all fund movements are properly controlled and audited.**

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Disbursement requests are received from Loan Origination via event-driven integration
2. Dual authorization workflow is implemented using AdminService approval patterns
3. Funding source validation ensures sufficient branch float or central account balances
4. Disbursement execution integrates with banking APIs through Vault-managed credentials
5. Idempotency is implemented to prevent double-processing of disbursement requests
6. Audit trails are generated for all disbursement activities through AdminService

## Dev Notes

### Technical Context from Architecture Documents

**Event-Driven Integration:**
- Follow RabbitMQ event patterns from ClientManagement service
- Use MassTransit consumer implementation patterns
- Implement event ordering and deduplication following existing patterns
- Use circuit breakers for external service resilience [Source: brownfield-architecture.md#event-driven-architecture]

**Camunda Workflow Integration:**
- Extend existing BPMN patterns from LoanOriginationService
- Use Zeebe task definitions: `treasury-disbursement`, `treasury-approval`
- Follow dual control workflow patterns from AdminService
- Implement worker classes following ClientManagement Camunda worker patterns [Source: brownfield-architecture.md#camunda-workflow-integration]

**Financial Data Models:**
- Use existing GL account structures from FinancialService
- Implement TreasuryTransaction entity following established patterns
- Add funding source entities with proper relationships
- Follow double-entry accounting validation patterns [Source: brownfield-architecture.md#data-models-and-integration-points]

**Security Implementation:**
- Implement mTLS for all external API communications
- Use Vault for bank API credentials following AdminService patterns
- Add dual authorization checks through AdminService elevation requests
- Implement comprehensive audit logging with structured events [Source: brownfield-architecture.md#security-implementation]

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Testing Standards:**
- Test financial calculations with precision validation
- Mock external banking APIs using established patterns
- Test idempotency logic with various scenarios
- Validate dual authorization workflow state management
- Test audit event generation and formatting [Source: brownfield-architecture.md#testing-standards]

**Integration Testing:**

- FinancialService GL posting validation
- Banking API integration with mocked responses
- Audit trail completeness verification

**Performance Testing:**
- Load testing for concurrent disbursement processing
- Database query performance validation
- Event processing throughput testing
- Memory usage validation under load

### Technical Constraints and Integration Notes

**Idempotency Implementation:**
- Every disbursement request must have unique idempotency key
- Transaction state must be persisted before external API calls
- Failed transactions must be retryable with proper state recovery
- Double-entry accounting must be maintained even on retries

**Dual Control Requirements:**
- All disbursements > threshold require two-person approval
- Approval workflow must integrate with AdminService role management
- Audit trail must capture both initiator and approver actions
- Emergency override procedures must be documented and tested

**Banking API Integration:**
- Use Vault for all credentials and API keys
- Implement mTLS for secure communication
- Add circuit breakers for API failure handling
- Support multiple banking partners with pluggable adapters

**Financial Data Integrity:**
- All balance updates must be atomic operations
- Redis caching for real-time balance updates
- Database transactions for financial consistency
- Validation against Chart of Accounts from FinancialService

### Integration Verification Points

**Existing System Integrity:**
- Loan Origination workflows complete successfully with Treasury integration
- AdminService approval mechanisms handle financial authorization correctly
- FinancialService GL posting continues without disruption
- Event ordering between services remains consistent
- Collections processing unaffected by Treasury operations

**Performance Validation:**
- Database query performance meets existing benchmarks
- Event processing doesn't introduce delays in loan workflows
- Balance updates are sub-second as required
- Memory usage aligns with existing service patterns

## Testing

**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- Unit tests using xUnit framework following FinancialService patterns
- Integration tests with Entity Framework and event-driven architecture
- API testing with authentication and authorization validation
- Performance testing to ensure no impact on existing financial operations
- Security testing for all financial endpoints and audit trails

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- Business logic components: >95% coverage
- Event processing and consumers: >95% coverage
- API controllers and validation: >90% coverage
- Error handling and recovery: 100% coverage
- Security and authorization: 100% coverage
