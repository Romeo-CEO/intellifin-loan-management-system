- Digital signatures must be validated and stored
- Audit trails must meet BoZ retention and accessibility requirements

**WORM Retention:**
- All financial documents must be stored with WORM protection
- Retention periods must meet regulatory requirements
- Document integrity must be validated and maintained
- Access to WORM documents must be logged and audited

### Integration Verification Points

**Existing System Integrity:**
- AdminService audit trails are enhanced with Treasury operations
- Vault integration follows established patterns for credential management
- CommunicationsService security notifications remain functional
- MinIO document storage patterns are properly extended
- IdentityService authentication continues without disruption

**Security Validation:**
