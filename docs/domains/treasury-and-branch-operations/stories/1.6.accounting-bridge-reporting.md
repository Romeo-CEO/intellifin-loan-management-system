## Dev Notes

### Technical Context from Architecture Documents

**Accounting Bridge Pattern:**
- Convert Treasury financial events into proper GL entries
- Maintain double-entry accounting for all operations
- Follow FinancialService GeneralLedgerService patterns
- Support both internal GL and external ERP destinations [Source: brownfield-architecture.md#accounting-bridge-architecture]

**Chart of Accounts Integration:**
- Use existing Chart of Accounts from Financial Accounting module
- Extend account structure for Treasury-specific transactions
- Follow transaction processing rules from Financial Accounting documentation
- Maintain BoZ compliance for all account classifications [Source: brownfield-architecture.md#financial-accounting-integration]

**Regulatory Reporting:**
- Integrate with FinancialService compliance monitoring
- Generate BoZ reports including Treasury operations data
- Follow established regulatory reporting patterns
- Maintain audit trails for all regulatory calculations [Source: brownfield-architecture.md#regulatory-compliance]

**External ERP Readiness:**
- Build pluggable adapter architecture for future ERP integration
- Maintain clean separation between internal and external accounting
- Support configuration-driven accounting rules
- Enable future ERP migration without Treasury code changes [Source: brownfield-architecture.md#future-integration-readiness]

- New Treasury accounts must follow existing numbering conventions
- Integration must support both automated and manual account mapping

**Regulatory Compliance:**
- All accounting entries must support BoZ reporting requirements
- Audit trails must capture complete transaction lifecycle
- Regulatory calculations must use approved methodologies
- Document retention must meet BoZ archival requirements

**External ERP Integration:**
- Must support multiple ERP systems simultaneously
- Configuration-driven adapter selection and setup
- Data transformation between internal and external formats
- Error handling for ERP communication failures

### Integration Verification Points

- AdminService audit trails enhanced with accounting events

**Accounting Accuracy:**
- All Treasury operations generate balanced double-entry transactions
- GL entries map correctly to established Chart of Accounts
- Regulatory reports include accurate Treasury data
- External ERP integration maintains data consistency

**Performance Validation:**
