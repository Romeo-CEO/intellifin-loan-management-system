# Cash Management Workflows - Limelight Moneylink Services

## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive cash management workflows for the Limelight Moneylink Services LMS system, covering vault management, teller till operations, and dual control procedures to ensure secure and auditable cash handling within the branch network.

## Business Context

### Why Cash Management is Critical
- **Financial Security**: Protecting cash assets through secure vault and till management
- **Operational Control**: Ensuring proper cash flow and availability for daily operations
- **Audit Compliance**: Maintaining complete audit trails for all cash movements
- **Risk Management**: Implementing dual control to prevent fraud and errors
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meeting BoZ requirements for cash handling and reporting

### Cash Management Philosophy
- **Dual Control**: All cash movements require two authorized approvals
- **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation of all cash transactions
- **Segregation of Duties**: Clear separation between cash handling and approval functions
- **Real-Time Processing**: Cash movements processed immediately with proper controls
- **Centralized Oversight**: Head office maintains oversight of all branch cash operations
