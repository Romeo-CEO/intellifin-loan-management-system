# End-of-Day Procedures - Limelight Moneylink Services

## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive end-of-day (EOD) procedures for the Limelight Moneylink Services LMS system, implementing the "Continuous Processing with a Centralized, Controlled Cutoff" philosophy. It covers the multi-stage process for closing the financial day, including branch-level balancing and the final, centralized EOD execution by the head office.

## Business Context

### Why End-of-Day Procedures are Critical
- **Financial Integrity**: Ensuring accurate daily financial closure and reporting
- **Risk Management**: Preventing fraud and errors through controlled cutoff procedures
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meeting BoZ requirements for daily financial reporting
- **Audit Readiness**: Maintaining complete audit trails for all daily operations
- **Operational Control**: Centralized oversight of branch operations and cash positions

### EOD Philosophy: "Continuous Processing with a Centralized, Controlled Cutoff"
**Core Principles**:
```
EOD Model:
- Continuous Processing: Most financial transactions happen in real-time during the day
- Centralized Cutoff: End-of-Day is a centralized, head-office-controlled procedure
- Branch Independence: Branch operations are independent during business hours
- Final Control: Only Head Office executes the final, system-wide EOD
- Financial Integrity: Single, company-wide event ensures financial accuracy
```

**EOD Stages**:
```
EOD Process:
Stage 1: Teller End-of-Shift Balancing (Branch Level)
Stage 2: Branch Manager "Branch Close" (Branch Level)
Stage 3: Head Office EOD Execution (Centralized)
```

## Stage 1: Teller End-of-Shift Balancing

### 1. Teller Balancing Process
**Balancing Workflow**:
```
Teller End-of-Shift Balancing:
1. Teller initiates end-of-shift process
2. System displays Expected Cash balance
3. Teller enters Actual Counted Cash
4. System calculates variance (if any)
5. Variance handling (if applicable)
6. Teller shift status update
7. Audit trail creation
```

**Expected Cash Calculation**:
```
Expected Cash Formula:
Expected Cash = Opening Balance + Cash Receipts - Cash Disbursements + Transfers In - Transfers Out
```

**Variance Calculation**:
```
Variance Formula:
Variance = Actual Counted Cash - Expected Cash
- Positive Variance: Cash Surplus
- Negative Variance: Cash Shortage
```

### 2. Variance Handling Process
**Variance Scenarios**:
```
Variance Handling:
- Zero Variance: Teller shift marked as "Balanced"
- Small Variance (within tolerance): Auto-approval with notification
- Large Variance (outside tolerance): Requires Head Office approval
```

**Variance Approval Process**:
```
Variance Approval Workflow:
1. Teller and Branch Manager cannot approve large variances
2. Detailed justification must be entered
3. Variance submitted for Head Office approval
4. Teller shift status: "Balanced - Pending Variance Approval"
5. Head Office reviews and decides (approve/reject)
6. Final status update and GL posting
```

**Variance Documentation**:
```
Required Information:
- Variance amount and type (shortage/surplus)
- Detailed justification
- Supporting documentation
- Teller and Branch Manager signatures
- Timestamp and audit trail
- Head Office approval/rejection
```

### 3. Teller Shift Status Management
**Shift Status Types**:
```
Shift Status Categories:
- "Active": Teller currently working
- "Balanced": Shift completed with zero variance
- "Balanced - Pending Variance Approval": Shift completed with variance pending approval
- "Balanced - Variance Approved": Shift completed with approved variance
- "Balanced - Variance Rejected": Shift completed with rejected variance
- "Closed": Shift officially closed
```

**Status Transitions**:
```
Status Workflow:
Active → Balanced (zero variance)
Active → Balanced - Pending Variance Approval (with variance)
Balanced - Pending Variance Approval → Balanced - Variance Approved (HO approval)
Balanced - Pending Variance Approval → Balanced - Variance Rejected (HO rejection)
All Statuses → Closed (final closure)
```

## Stage 2: Branch Manager "Branch Close"

### 1. Branch Close Process
**Branch Close Workflow**:
```
Branch Close Procedure:
1. Branch Manager initiates "Branch Close"
2. System presents completion checklist
3. Checklist validation and verification
4. Branch status update to "Pending EOD"
5. Transaction posting restriction
6. Audit trail creation
```

**Branch Close Checklist**:
```
Required Checklist Items:
- All tellers have completed end-of-shift balancing
- All cash has been returned to vault
- All transactions have been posted
- All exceptions have been resolved
- All documentation is complete
- Branch Manager approval and signature
```

### 2. Branch Status Management
**Branch Status Types**:
```
Branch Status Categories:
- "Open": Branch operating normally
- "Closing": Branch in closing process
- "Pending EOD": Branch closed, awaiting Head Office EOD
- "EOD Complete": Branch EOD completed
- "Locked": Branch locked for reconciliation
```

**Status Transitions**:
```
Status Workflow:
Open → Closing (Branch Manager initiates close)
Closing → Pending EOD (Checklist completed)
Pending EOD → EOD Complete (Head Office EOD executed)
Pending EOD → Locked (Force close by Head Office)
```

### 3. Transaction Restriction
**Posting Restrictions**:
```
Restriction Rules:
- No new transactions can be posted after "Pending EOD"
- Existing transactions can be modified only with Head Office approval
- Emergency transactions require Head Office authorization
- All restrictions are logged and audited
```

**Exception Handling**:
```
Exception Process:
1. Emergency transaction request
2. Head Office authorization required
3. Special approval workflow
4. Transaction processing with audit trail
5. Branch status review and update
```

## Stage 3: Head Office EOD Execution

### 1. Head Office EOD Process
**EOD Execution Workflow**:
```
Head Office EOD Process:
1. Authorized Head Office Finance user initiates EOD
2. System reviews all branch statuses
3. Variance queue processing
4. Final EOD execution
5. Business date advancement
6. System state update
```

**EOD Authorization**:
```
Authorization Requirements:
- Head Office Finance Officer or higher
- Dual authorization for final EOD
- System validation of user permissions
- Audit trail of authorization
- Confirmation of EOD execution
```

### 2. Variance Queue Processing
**Variance Review Process**:
```
Variance Processing Workflow:
1. Head Office Finance Officer reviews variance queue
2. Each variance is evaluated individually
3. Decision: Approve or Reject
4. GL posting based on decision
5. Branch notification of decision
6. Audit trail creation
```

**Happy Path - Variance Approval**:
```
Approval Process:
1. Head Office Officer reviews justification
2. Justification is acceptable
3. Officer approves variance
4. System posts to appropriate GL account:
   - Cash Shortage: DR [Cash Shortage Expense Account] / CR [Teller Till Account]
   - Cash Surplus: DR [Teller Till Account] / CR [Cash Surplus Income Account]
5. Branch is notified of approval
6. Audit trail is created
```

**Edge Case - Unacceptable Variance**:
```
Rejection Process:
1. Head Office Officer reviews justification
2. Justification is unacceptable
3. Officer rejects variance
4. System forces creation of "Incident Report"
5. Incident Report is logged with unique ID
6. Officer is given "Force Balance with Incident #[IncidentID]" option
7. When executed, variance is posted provisionally to Cash Shortage Expense Account
8. Incident ID is included in memo for audit trail
9. Internal Audit team is notified for investigation
```

### 3. Incident Report System
**Incident Report Creation**:
```
Incident Report Process:
1. System automatically creates incident report
2. Unique incident ID is generated
3. Incident details are captured:
   - Variance amount and type
   - Teller and branch information
   - Original justification
   - Rejection reason
   - Timestamp and user information
4. Incident is assigned to Internal Audit team
5. Investigation workflow is initiated
```

**Force Balance with Incident**:
```
Force Balance Process:
1. Head Office Officer selects "Force Balance with Incident #[IncidentID]"
2. System posts variance to Cash Shortage Expense Account
3. Incident ID is included in transaction memo
4. Provisional posting is created
5. Internal Audit team is notified
6. Investigation and resolution workflow begins
```

### 4. Final EOD Execution
**Final EOD Process**:
```
Final EOD Workflow:
1. All variances are resolved (approved or forced balance)
2. Head Office Officer executes "Final EOD"
3. System enters "Financial Lock" state
4. Business date is advanced
5. All branches are marked as "EOD Complete"
6. System state is updated
7. Audit trail is created
```

**Financial Lock State**:
```
Lock State Features:
- Brief system lock during EOD execution
