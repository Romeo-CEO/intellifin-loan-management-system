# Epic and Story Structure

Based on my analysis of your existing project, I believe this enhancement should be structured as **a single comprehensive epic** because the Collections & Recovery module represents a cohesive, end-to-end lifecycle within a single service, with clearly defined stages and interdependencies. Breaking it into multiple high-level epics might fragment the holistic view of the collections process. Does this align with your understanding of the work required?

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: A single comprehensive epic (e.g., "Collections & Recovery Module Implementation") will encapsulate all the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in this PRD. This approach ensures that all stories contribute to a unified goal, making it easier to track progress, manage dependencies, and maintain a holistic view of the Collections Lifecycle Management.
