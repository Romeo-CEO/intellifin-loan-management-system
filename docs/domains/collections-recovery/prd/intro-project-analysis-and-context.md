### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals

-   Maintain healthy loan portfolio and minimize losses.
-   Adhere to Bank of Zambia (BoZ) directives for loan classification and provisioning.
-   Ensure consistent cash flow for business operations.
-   Balance collections with customer retention and satisfaction.
-   Early identification and management of credit risks.
-   Achieve a fully digital and auditable lending loop from origination to closure.

#### Background Context

With Credit Assessment and upstream loan origination workflows now stable, the Collections & Recovery module is the next critical piece of the IntelliFin Loan Management System. This module will manage all activities after a loan has been disbursed, encompassing repayments, arrears tracking, automated reminders, and recovery workflows. Its successful implementation is paramount for maintaining the business's financial health, ensuring compliance with BoZ provisioning and classification requirements, and transforming raw loan data into actionable financial operations and compliance insights.
