# Security Integration

Ensure security consistency with existing system:

1. Follow existing security patterns and tools
2. Ensure new features don't introduce vulnerabilities
3. Maintain existing security posture
4. Define security testing for new components

### Existing Security Measures

**Authentication:** Bearer JWT tokens issued by IntelliFin IdentityService are used for API authentication across services.
**Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced via JWT claims and application-level authorization policies.
**Data Protection:** TLS in transit, TDE for SQL Server, and field-level encryption for PII where needed. Vault for managing secrets.
**Security Tools:** Roslyn analyzers for code security, security scanners in CI/CD (assumed), external penetration testing.

### Enhancement Security Requirements

**New Security Measures:**
-   **Dual Control for Write-Offs**: Implement a robust Camunda-orchestrated dual control workflow for loan write-offs, requiring approvals from specified roles (e.g., Head of Credit, Senior Finance Manager).
-   **Granular Authorization**: Implement fine-grained, role-based authorization for collections-specific operations (e.g., `collections:manage:payments`, `collections:manage:writeoffs`, `collections:read:overdue`).
-   **Step-Up Authentication**: Consider implementing step-up authentication for highly sensitive actions like manual write-off initiation or loan restructuring, integrating with the IdentityService.
**Integration Points:**
-   **IdentityService**: For user authentication and authorization (roles/claims).
-   **AdminService**: For comprehensive audit logging of all security-sensitive actions, including user who performed action, timestamps, and before/after states of critical data.
-   **Vault**: For secure storage and retrieval of sensitive collections policies and configuration.
**Compliance Requirements:** Adherence to BoZ security directives and Consumer Protection Standards regarding data privacy and fair collections practices.

### Security Testing

**Existing Security Tests:** Existing IntelliFin security testing practices will be applied, including automated security scans in CI/CD.
**New Security Test Requirements:**
-   **Authorization Matrix Tests**: Automated tests to verify correct role-based access for all new CollectionsService API endpoints.
-   **Dual Control Workflow Tests**: Dedicated integration tests for the write-off dual control workflow, ensuring all approval steps and audit trails are correctly enforced.
-   **Input Validation Tests**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests for all API inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection).
-   **Vulnerability Scanning**: Inclusion of the CollectionsService in regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing efforts.
**Penetration Testing:** Dedicated penetration testing for the CollectionsService will be conducted, with a focus on authentication bypasses, authorization flaws, data manipulation, and workflow integrity.
