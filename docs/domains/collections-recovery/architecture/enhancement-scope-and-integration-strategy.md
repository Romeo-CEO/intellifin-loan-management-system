# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

Based on my analysis, the integration approach I'm proposing takes into account the existing IntelliFin microservice architecture, established messaging patterns (RabbitMQ/MassTransit), centralized configuration management (Vault), and workflow orchestration (Camunda). These integration points and boundaries respect your current architecture patterns. Is this assessment accurate?

### Enhancement Overview

**Enhancement Type:** New Feature Addition, Integration with New Systems, Automated Collections Lifecycle Management
**Scope:** Implement the IntelliFin Collections & Recovery module, encompassing automated repayment scheduling, payment reconciliation, BoZ-compliant arrears classification and provisioning, a Camunda-orchestrated collections workflow, and automated customer notifications.
**Integration Impact:** Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes), Major Impact (architectural changes required)

### Integration Approach

**Code Integration Strategy:** The CollectionsService will be a new, independent microservice. It will not directly modify existing codebase of other services, but will interact through defined APIs and events. Shared libraries will be used for common contracts and utilities where appropriate.

**Database Integration:** The CollectionsService will manage its own dedicated SQL Server database for all collections-related persistent data. Data from other services (e.g., loan details, client information) will be consumed via event streams to maintain data ownership and loose coupling.

**API Integration:** The CollectionsService will expose a new set of REST APIs for collections-specific operations and will consume existing IntelliFin APIs (e.g., Vault). All new APIs will adhere to existing IntelliFin API patterns for authentication, authorization, and headers.

**UI Integration:** No direct UI integration within this service. Future UI components (e.g., Collections Workbench) will consume the CollectionsService's exposed APIs.

### Compatibility Requirements

-   **Existing API Compatibility:** New CollectionsService APIs must adhere to existing IntelliFin API patterns (JWT auth, `X-Correlation-Id`, `X-Branch-Id` headers, standard HTTP status codes).
-   **Database Schema Compatibility:** Any new database schema changes must be additive and not break existing dependent services (e.g., Loan Origination).
-   **UI/UX Consistency:** Any future UI components related to collections (e.g., Collections Workbench) must adhere to the existing `lms-ux-style-guide.md` and overall IntelliFin design system.
-   **Performance Impact:** The CollectionsService's operations, especially nightly batch jobs, must not negatively impact the performance of existing IntelliFin services or overall system responsiveness.
