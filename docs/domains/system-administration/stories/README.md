## 💡 Using These Stories

### For Development Team

**Starting a Sprint**:
1. Review Phase/Sprint stories from the table above
2. Open the corresponding story file
3. Review Acceptance Criteria, Technical Implementation, and Architecture References
4. Check Dependencies are completed before starting

**During Implementation**:
- Follow Technical Implementation Details section for code samples
- Reference Architecture document sections linked in each story
- Use Database Schema and API Endpoint specifications
- Validate against Integration Verification criteria

**Story Completion**:
- Complete all items in Definition of Done (DoD) checklist
- Update story status in this README
- Notify QA team for testing

### For Scrum Master

**Sprint Planning**:
- Stories organized by Phase (aligned with 12-month timeline)
- Dependency graph prevents out-of-order implementation
- Story points guide capacity planning

**Progress Tracking**:
- Update story status in tables above as work progresses
- Track completed story points per phase
- Monitor for dependency blockers

### For Architects

**Architecture Alignment**:
- Each story references specific Architecture document sections
- ADRs (Architectural Decision Records) embedded in stories
- Technical stack decisions locked in per story

## 🔄 Story Creation Workflow

### Approach
Stories are created following the **Scrum Master brownfield workflow** from `.bmad-core/workflows/brownfield-fullstack.yaml`:

1. **Detailed Individual Stories** (Stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.14): ~400-700 lines each
   - Complete acceptance criteria with Given/When/Then format
   - Full technical implementation with code samples
   - Database schemas, API endpoints, integration tests
   - Risks, DoD checklist, integration verification

2. **Individual Detailed Stories (All)**
   - All stories are created as individual, detailed documents
   - Includes acceptance criteria, implementation details, and full references
   - Consolidation is discouraged to maintain clarity and single-source traceability

### Story Template Structure
Each story follows consistent template:
- Story Metadata (ID, Points, Effort, Dependencies, Blocks)
- User Story (As a/I want/So that format)
- Business Value
- Acceptance Criteria (AC1-ACN with Given/When/Then)
- Technical Implementation Details
  - Architecture References
  - Technology Stack
  - Database Schema
  - API Endpoints
  - Service Implementation (code samples)
- Integration Verification (IV1-IVN)
- Testing Strategy (Unit, Integration, Performance, Security)
- Risks and Mitigation
- Definition of Done (DoD) checklist
- Related Documentation
- Notes for Development Team
