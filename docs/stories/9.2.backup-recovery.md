## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- Integrates with SQL Server Always On for database backups
- Uses MinIO for document and file backups
- Connects to existing monitoring system for alerts
- Leverages existing audit system for compliance tracking

### Testing Standards
- **Test file location**: `tests/services/backup/`
- **Test standards**: Unit tests for backup services, integration tests for recovery procedures
- **Testing frameworks**: xUnit for backend, Jest for frontend
- **Specific requirements**: Test backup integrity, validate recovery procedures

### Architecture Integration
- Uses SQL Server Always On for database backup and recovery
- Integrates with MinIO for document and file backup
- Connects to existing monitoring system for backup alerts
- Leverages existing audit system for compliance tracking

### Business Rules
- Backups must be performed daily with multiple retention policies
- Recovery procedures must be tested quarterly
- All backup and recovery activities must be audited
- Data retention must comply with BoZ and Money Lenders Act requirements
