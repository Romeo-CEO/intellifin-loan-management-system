# Story 5.3: Payment Gateway Optimization

## Story Overview
**Epic:** Sprint 4 - Advanced Financial Operations  
**Story ID:** 5.3  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Priority:** High  
**Assignee:** James (Dev Agent)  
**Sprint:** 4  
**Status:** Completed

## Story
As a financial operations manager, I want optimized payment processing with enhanced Tingg and PMEC integrations, retry mechanisms, and automated reconciliation so that payment transactions are reliable, fast, and automatically reconciled.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tingg payment gateway optimization with enhanced error handling
- [ ] PMEC integration enhancement with improved reliability
- [ ] Payment retry mechanisms with exponential backoff and circuit breakers
- [ ] Transaction reconciliation automation with discrepancy detection
- [ ] Payment status tracking with real-time updates
- [ ] Error handling and recovery with comprehensive logging
- [ ] Performance monitoring with sub-2-second payment processing
- [ ] Security enhancements with PCI DSS compliance measures

## Dev Notes
Implementation builds upon existing IntelliFin.FinancialService payment infrastructure:
- PaymentRetryService.cs and PaymentReconciliationService.cs exist but need optimization
- PaymentMonitoringService.cs needs performance enhancements
- Polly resilience patterns already configured
- Integration with Tingg and PMEC APIs via existing services

## Tasks
- [ ] Optimize PaymentRetryService.cs with enhanced retry strategies
- [ ] Enhance PaymentReconciliationService.cs with automated discrepancy detection
- [ ] Implement PaymentMonitoringService.cs real-time monitoring
- [ ] Create PaymentOptimizationController.cs for management endpoints
- [ ] Add comprehensive payment transaction logging
- [ ] Implement payment performance metrics collection
- [ ] Create automated payment reconciliation workflows
- [ ] Add payment gateway health monitoring
- [ ] Enhance error handling with detailed categorization
- [ ] Implement payment security audit logging
- [ ] Create unit tests for all payment optimization components
- [ ] Create integration tests for payment workflows
- [ ] Performance test payment processing under load
- [ ] Validate sub-2-second payment processing requirement

## Testing
### Unit Tests
- [ ] PaymentRetryService optimization tests
- [ ] PaymentReconciliationService automation tests
- [ ] PaymentMonitoringService performance tests
- [ ] PaymentOptimizationController endpoint tests

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end payment processing workflows
- [ ] Tingg payment gateway integration
- [ ] PMEC deduction processing
- [ ] Payment reconciliation automation

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Payment processing time < 2 seconds
- [ ] Concurrent payment handling (50+ payments)
- [ ] Payment gateway failover scenarios
- [ ] Reconciliation performance with large datasets
