```

## Settlement File Processing

### 1. File Ingestion Process
**Ingestion Workflow**:
```
Settlement File Ingestion:
1. Scheduled job runs daily at 06:00 CAT
2. Payment Processing Service connects to Tingg's SFTP server
3. Downloads daily Settlement Report (CSV format)
4. Validates file integrity and format
5. Stores file in secure location
6. Initiates parsing and processing
```

**File Specifications**:
```
Settlement File Format:
- File Type: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- File Name: settlement_report_YYYYMMDD.csv
- Delivery Method: SFTP
- Delivery Time: Daily at 05:00 CAT
- File Size: Variable (based on transaction volume)
```

**File Structure**:
```
CSV File Columns:
- Transaction ID
- Transaction Date
- Transaction Type (Disbursement/Collection)
- Customer Mobile Number
- Gross Amount
- Tingg Fee
- Net Settlement Amount
- Transaction Status
- Reference Number
- Network (MTN/Airtel)
```

### 2. File Validation and Parsing
**Validation Process**:
```
File Validation:
1. File existence and accessibility check
2. File format and structure validation
3. Data integrity verification
4. Transaction count validation
5. Amount reconciliation check
6. Error logging and reporting
```

**Parsing Process**:
```
File Parsing:
1. CSV file parsing and data extraction
2. Data type validation and conversion
3. Business rule validation
4. Duplicate transaction detection
5. Data enrichment and formatting
6. Database storage preparation
```

## Transaction Matching

### 1. Matching Process
**Matching Workflow**:
```
Transaction Matching:
1. Load settlement file transactions
2. Query internal transaction database
3. Match transactions by reference number
4. Validate amount and date consistency
5. Flag unmatched transactions
6. Generate matching report
```

**Matching Criteria**:
```
Matching Rules:
- Primary: Reference Number (exact match)
- Secondary: Transaction ID (exact match)
- Tertiary: Mobile Number + Amount + Date (fuzzy match)
- Validation: Amount and date consistency check
- Exception: Unmatched transactions flagged
```

### 2. Matching Results
**Matching Categories**:
```
Matching Results:
- Matched: Transaction found and validated
- Unmatched: Transaction not found in internal system
- Duplicate: Multiple matches found
- Amount Mismatch: Reference matches but amount differs
- Date Mismatch: Reference matches but date differs
- Status Mismatch: Reference matches but status differs
```

**Matching Statistics**:
```
Matching Metrics:
- Total transactions in settlement file
- Successfully matched transactions
- Unmatched transactions
- Duplicate transactions
- Amount mismatches
- Date mismatches
- Matching success rate
```

## Fee Calculation and GL Posting

### 1. Fee Calculation
**Fee Processing**:
```
Fee Calculation Process:

6. Validate posting requirements
```

**Fee Structure**:
```
Fee Components:
- Base Transaction Fee

```

### 2. GL Posting Rules
**Posting Rules**:
```
GL Posting Rule:
DR [Technology Expense - Gateway Fees] - [Tingg Fee Amount]
CR [Cash - Tingg Gateway] - [Tingg Fee Amount]

Example:
DR Technology Expense - Gateway Fees - ZMW 25.00
CR Cash - Tingg Gateway - ZMW 25.00
```

**Posting Process**:
```
GL Posting Workflow:
1. Calculate fee amount from settlement file
