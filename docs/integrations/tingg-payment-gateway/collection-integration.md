}
```

**Receiving Payment Confirmations (Callbacks)**:
```
Callback Mechanism:
The callback_url provided in the setup request is critical. Our Payment Processing Service will expose a secure webhook endpoint. Each month, after Tingg processes the recurring payment, they will send a notification (a callback) to this URL with the status of each transaction (success or failure). Our service will consume this callback, and for each successful payment, it will publish a PaymentReceivedViaTingg event to trigger the GL posting and loan balance update.
```
