## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive integration with the Zambian government's Public Service Management Division (PSMD) payroll system for automated loan deductions from government employee salaries. The PMEC integration is the cornerstone of our Government Employee Payroll Loan product, providing guaranteed repayments and operational efficiency.

## Business Context

### Why PMEC Integration is Critical
- **Guaranteed Repayments**: Deductions occur automatically before borrowers receive salaries
- **Operational Efficiency**: Eliminates manual collection processes
- **Risk Mitigation**: Primary risk mitigation strategy for government employee loans
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets BoZ requirements for payroll-backed lending

### Integration Benefits
- **Automated Collections**: 100% automated monthly deductions
- **Predictable Cash Flow**: Fixed repayment schedules
- **Reduced Default Risk**: Payroll deduction eliminates payment delays
- **Customer Convenience**: Seamless repayment experience for government employees

## Regulatory Framework

### Government Authorities
- **PSMD**: Public Service Management Division (manages government payroll)
- **BoZ**: Bank of Zambia (regulatory oversight)
- **ZRA**: Zambia Revenue Authority (tax compliance)

### Legal Requirements
- **Business Registration**: Must be registered with Registrar of Societies or as limited company
- **Microfinance License**: Operating license from Bank of Zambia
- **Tax Compliance**: Valid ZRA Tax Clearance Certificate
- **Note**: Loan tenure requirements are governed by our Product Catalog, which defines terms from 1-60 months for government employee loans

## PMEC Integration Architecture

### System Overview
```
(Client Svc, Loan Origination Svc, Collections Svc) ←→ PMEC Anti-Corruption Layer ←→ Government Payroll System
     ↓                    ↓                           ↓
Loan Processing    Data Transformation      Salary Deductions
Collections        Audit Logging           Payment Distribution
```

### Integration Components
1. **PMEC Anti-Corruption Layer**: Dedicated microservice for government system integration
2. **Queue Management**: Local queue system for PMEC downtime resilience
3. **Data Transformation**: Government data format compliance
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction logging for compliance
5. **Fallback Procedures**: Manual collection when PMEC unavailable

## Integration Process Flow

### 1. Initial Setup Phase
```
Business Registration → BoZ License → ZRA Tax Clearance → PSMD Application → Deduction Code
```

### 2. Operational Flow
```
Loan Approval → PMEC Registration → Monthly Deduction → Payment Processing → Reconciliation
```

### 3. Monthly Deduction Cycle
```
Salary Calculation → Deduction Processing → Payment Transfer → LMS Credit → Customer Notification
```

## Technical Implementation

### API Integration
- **Integration Method**: The PMEC Anti-Corruption Layer will establish a connection to the PSMD system, adapting to its required protocol (REST, SOAP, or other). The rest of the LMS platform will communicate with our ACL via a clean, internal REST API.
- **Data Format**: Government-standard payroll data format
- **Authentication**: Secure government credential management
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect government system capacity limits

### Queue Architecture
- **Queue Technology**: Self-hosted RabbitMQ instance running within our Kubernetes cluster
- **Retry Logic**: The PMEC ACL will handle message consumption from RabbitMQ. For transient PMEC system failures, the message will be NACK'd (Not Acknowledged) and returned to the queue for retry with an exponential backoff policy. After N failed attempts, the message will be moved to a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) for manual intervention.
- **Message Persistence**: Guaranteed message delivery
- **Conflict Resolution**: Business rule prioritization

### Data Security
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for government employee data
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for PMEC data
- **Audit Logging**: Complete transaction audit trail
- **Data Sovereignty**: Zambian server compliance
