# Zambian Microfinance Back-Office Loan Management System - Project Specification

## Elevator Pitch

A BoZ-compliant, cloud-native **back-office loan management platform** specifically engineered for Zambian microfinance institutions, featuring PMEC integration for government employee payroll deductions, traditional disbursement workflows (bank/cash), and future-ready architecture - designed to scale seamlessly from 500 loans to 10,000+ loans while maintaining regulatory compliance and operational excellence.

## Problem Statement

Zambian microfinance institutions need a **robust back-office loan management system** that combines strict regulatory compliance with operational efficiency for processing government employee payroll loans. Existing solutions either lack BoZ compliance, can't integrate with PMEC for government payroll deductions, or don't meet Zambian data sovereignty requirements. New institutions need enterprise-grade back-office capabilities at startup pricing with guaranteed scalability.

- Field-based loan officers using tablets
- Underwriters processing government employee applications
- Collections team managing payroll deductions
- Finance staff handling BoZ compliance

**Secondary Users:**
- BoZ regulators accessing compliance reports
- Auditors requiring full transaction trails
- PMEC system for payroll deduction processing

## USP

The only **back-office loan management system** engineered specifically for Zambian regulatory requirements, featuring mandatory BoZ compliance, **PMEC integration for government employee payroll deductions**, traditional banking workflows, and future-ready mobile money architecture - all designed to scale from startup to enterprise without re-architecture.

## Target Platforms

- **Primary**: Progressive Web Application (tablet-optimized for field officers)
- **CEO Dashboard**: Secure desktop application with offline operational continuity capabilities and on-demand sync
- **Phase 2**: Customer-facing borrower portal and mobile applications
