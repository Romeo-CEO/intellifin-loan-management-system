# Introduction

This document outlines the complete full-stack architecture for the Zambian Microfinance Loan Management System (LMS), incorporating all business rules, workflows, and compliance requirements defined across the domain specifications. This unified architecture covers both backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration, serving as the single source of truth for AI-driven development.

This comprehensive approach combines traditional backend and frontend architecture concerns, streamlining the development process for a modern full-stack application where these concerns are increasingly intertwined, while ensuring strict compliance with Zambian regulatory requirements and business workflows.
