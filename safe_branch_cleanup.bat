echo [INFO] Step 4: Manual cleanup required...
echo.
echo The following branches appear to be merged and safe to delete:
echo   - cursor/integrate-admin-service-audit-logging-2890 (Client Management)
echo   - feature/iam-remaining-work (IAM Enhancement)
echo   - codex/implement-vault-backed-runtime-secrets (Vault integration)
echo   - feature/client-management (Earlier client management work)
echo.
echo [WARN] ‚ö†Ô∏è  SAFETY CHECK: Please verify these are actually merged!
echo.

echo [INFO] Manual cleanup commands (run these in your git terminal):
echo.
echo REM Delete local branches:
echo git branch -d cursor/integrate-admin-service-audit-logging-2890
echo git branch -d feature/iam-remaining-work
echo git branch -d feature/client-management
echo.
echo REM Delete remote branches:
echo git push origin --delete cursor/integrate-admin-service-audit-logging-2890
echo git push origin --delete feature/iam-remaining-work
echo git push origin --delete feature/client-management
echo.
echo REM Verify cleanup:
echo git branch -a
echo git branch -r
echo.

echo [INFO] Branches to KEEP (do not delete):
echo   - master (main branch)
echo   - feature/collections-recovery (next implementation)
echo   - backup/* branches (for safety rollback)
echo.

echo [INFO] Step 5: Verification after cleanup...
echo.
echo After cleanup, verify with these commands:
echo   - git branch (should only show master and feature/collections-recovery)
echo   - git branch -r (should only show origin/master and origin/feature/collections-recovery)
echo   - git log --oneline -10 (should show recent merges)
echo.

echo [INFO] Cleanup completed! üéâ
echo.
echo üìã Summary:
echo ‚úÖ Backup branches preserved for safety
echo ‚úÖ Master branch and current work preserved
echo ‚úÖ Only merged branches deleted
echo.
echo üìã Next Steps:
echo 1. Verify application still works: git checkout master ^&^& dotnet build
echo 2. Test key functionality
echo 3. Delete backup branches after 30 days if everything works
echo 4. Begin Collections ^& Recovery implementation
echo.
